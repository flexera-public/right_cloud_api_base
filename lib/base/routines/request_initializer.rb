      # be needed when the cloud caches responses for similar requests. Lets say you listed instances
      # then created one and then listed them again. S-me clouds (rackspace) may start to report the
      # new seconds after it was created because of the caching they do.
      #
      # But if we mix something random onto every request then 2 consecutive list instances calls will
      # look like they are different and the cloud wont return the cached data.
